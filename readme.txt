A central admin dashboard that gives users an at-a-glance view into the content and data they care about most.

== Description ==

This plugin adds a new admin dashboard that gives users an at-a-glance view into the content and data they care about most.

Each user has their own Home screen. Each Home screen consists of the tabs and widgets the user has added to it.

Tabs are the system for organizing widgets. Users can create a tab for each view they want into certain content or data.

Widgets are the actual blocks of content or data. Widgets come in many types, and each type can be configured to only include the content or data users want. Users can click and drag on the title bar on widgets to reorder them.
